## Questions re: Your Writing

1. What types of writing do you do?

Literary non-fiction, poetry, experimental/lyrical essaying.

3. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I think the more experiences you have, the more external inspiration you will find. These experiences also shape your sense of self and out-ward facing lens/world view. In this way, you can utilise the natural impact of external influence to constantly evolve the way you receive and interpret ideas, and in turn how you respond to them creatively. People, conversation, relationships, observations... for this reason I am always interested in and actively choosing to place myself in situations where I will have new experiences and meet new people. I believe the comfort zone is not where development occurs, and that motivation is derived from challenge and exposure. I like to write in new places. 

4. Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use them to pursue engagement, to feel interested in what I am thinking, writing and talking about. I was not raised with the pre-conceived idea that what is coming from within (what I have to contribute to the world) is by default, interesting to other people. I love to listen, but to write is often to reflect on the innermost workings of your mind. I consider where those thoughts and ideas come from, and how I can develop the way I think to inform my creative practice in a more engaging way. 

5. How do these tools shape the way you write (eg constrain or facilitate)?

These (conceptual) tools allow me to combine structure with enjoyment. Writing can be isolating, it is traditionally a solo undertaking.  Incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others.

# Week 3

Idea for final assessment: Strava poetry

- I will plan out walking/cycling routes to spell out words on the Strava app, which will combine to become one large collage or series. The app tracks your movement on a map when you give it permission to do so. I am considering leaving the (screenshotted) words in an intentional 'jumble' or even creating a sort of user-friendly/interactive jigsaw puzzle out of them, although I think it might be too complicated to try and make a jigsaw where the pieces are movable on a screen.
  
- Another avenue would be to use these strava 'words' like a link to open onto larger format poems, eg. I would have some of these words (maybe 6 for example) collated together on a screen, acting as gateways to open up longer poems which would not be produced via strava. 
  
- I might also try to write out a long form poem purely on strava, where the screenshots will fade in and out on the screen one by one.. so the viewer is presented with one word at a time. This could also be done in a scroll format. It would be a challenge to work around a word count with this considering the amount of time and effort it will take. 

-   The content of the poems will be relevant to the intersection of bodily movement/creativity/technology: how the body is making the art/writing, the body moves to make the art, the intentionality behind every movement, every right and left turn, the relentlessness of technology to 'track', the lack of room for mistakes, the lack of backspace, you can't backpedal your track away...relating to the digital footprint and its eternal-ness. Kinetic movement and energy as it exists in both the digital and physical world. Transposing physical kinesis into digital kinesis and creating kinesis between the viewer and the creative work.

-   I could even AI-generate a list of words that relate to this concept and spell out those words. Or even, I could generate the next word of the poem whilst on a ride. As in, I could start with 'body' - whilst producing the word body on strava, I choose a word based on my surroundings or something significant that jumps out at me on the walk/ride. 

## Questions re: Defining Electronic Literature

1. What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

2. How are those elements meaningful?

3. How are the works read differently from print literature?

4. How is electronic literature different from print literature?

5. What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

gave me his number

scribbled in fine-liner pen

he slipped it to me on a discarded receipt

### 'computational experiments'

1. To Make a Dadaist Poem: (using my own writing)

Original text: The first time thinking about a thing I make the words go around and around and I’m spinning in my mind like a mirror, the words playing out like end credits that roll too fast and before I can grab onto a thought it gets lost in the linguistics, the poetics, how much I put myself into something, whether I want to put myself into it. Whether your eyes glaze over as the words merge into one and the letters turn into obsolete symbols, chiming vibration like a bell does to clock, the first is the only one that matters, echo the rest out of focus.

# Week 5

## Writing Hypertext Fiction

1. How is it different from fiction?
Known length. How meaning and narrative is made. 

2. How is it different from games?
Strategy, winning/losing/failing, rules. The act of playing the game makes/adds meaning. Meaning is made through play. The choices presented in electronic literature examples do not give more meaning to the literature as the play does not extend beyond the act of the click. Does it add meaning/is it useful to consider a work as a game? 

3. How do you plan fiction?
You can plan a linear or non-linear narrative structure. You can plan plot points/moments of contention, character profiles. Generally in a chronological sequence of events. 

4. How could you plan hypertext fiction?

Make a visual 'mind map' with pathways laid out.

_Create a Short Hypertext Fiction Plan_
When a child is faced with separation anxiety:

(and what would it look like if the imaginings of a child came to life?)

OUTCOMES: A. the car overheats and you die. B. a stranger kidnaps you. C. your mum never returns. D. your mum returns to the car and drives you home. E. cry until a stranger takes you the front desk. your first and last name is called out on the Coles intercom and a rumour spreads about you at primary school the week after. 

SCENARIO: your mum needs to go grocery shopping. you don't want to go, but you're too young to be left at home alone.

CHOICE: A go with your mum to supermarket OR B stay in the car.

A. you decide that you would rather listen to the music you just pirated onto your new ipod nano in the car than go into the supermarket. the supermarket is boring and the ipod nano is new and exciting.

B. you go with your mum to the supermarket. the fluorescent lights cloud your mind and visions of cucumber soldiers send your feet into the aisle with the Lindt Easter Bunnies. you realise you've lost your mum.

_Create a Short Branching Fiction Story_
It should be nine short paragraphs in length and each paragraph should link to or be linked from at least two others.
