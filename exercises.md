# Week 1

## Questions re: Your Writing

1. What types of writing do you do?

Literary non-fiction, poetry, experimental/lyrical essaying.

3. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I think the more experiences you have, the more external inspiration you will find. These experiences also shape your sense of self and out-ward facing lens/world view. In this way, you can utilise the natural impact of external influence to constantly evolve the way you receive and interpret ideas, and in turn how you respond to them creatively. People, conversation, relationships, observations... for this reason I am always interested in and actively choosing to place myself in situations where I will have new experiences and meet new people. I believe the comfort zone is not where development occurs, and that motivation is derived from challenge and exposure. I like to write in new places. 

4. Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use them to pursue engagement, to feel interested in what I am thinking, writing and talking about. I was not raised with the pre-conceived idea that what is coming from within (what I have to contribute to the world) is by default, interesting to other people. I love to listen, but to write is often to reflect on the innermost workings of your mind. I consider where those thoughts and ideas come from, and how I can develop the way I think to inform my creative practice in a more engaging way. 

5. How do these tools shape the way you write (eg constrain or facilitate)?

These (conceptual) tools allow me to combine structure with enjoyment. Writing can be isolating, it is traditionally a solo undertaking.  Incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others. 

6. What do you think digital writing is?

I think digital writing exists somewhere at the intersection of technology and literature, perhaps needing some kind of interactive or user-engaging element to differentiate it from reading other types of writing online. 

7. What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

I expect to develop a better understanding of how to define electronic literature, and what kinds of works will be appropriate and achieveable for us to develop (since I have no idea how to code or do anything slightly complicated on a computer). 

### Artist Bio Note

I am an experimental essayer and poet, that uses the natural impact of external influence to write generatively and respond to the world in a way that challenges the boundaries of the working human mind. I combine structure with enjoyment, and incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others.

# Week 3

Idea for final assessment: Strava poetry

- I will plan out walking/cycling routes to spell out words on the Strava app, which will combine to become one large collage or series. The app tracks your movement on a map when you give it permission to do so. I am considering leaving the (screenshotted) words in an intentional 'jumble' or even creating a sort of user-friendly/interactive jigsaw puzzle out of them, although I think it might be too complicated to try and make a jigsaw where the pieces are movable on a screen.
  
- Another avenue would be to use these strava 'words' like a link to open onto larger format poems, eg. I would have some of these words (maybe 6 for example) collated together on a screen, acting as gateways to open up longer poems which would not be produced via strava. 
  
- I might also try to write out a long form poem purely on strava, where the screenshots will fade in and out on the screen one by one.. so the viewer is presented with one word at a time. This could also be done in a scroll format. It would be a challenge to work around a word count with this considering the amount of time and effort it will take. 

-   The content of the poems will be relevant to the intersection of bodily movement/creativity/technology: how the body is making the art/writing, the body moves to make the art, the intentionality behind every movement, every right and left turn, the relentlessness of technology to 'track', the lack of room for mistakes, the lack of backspace, you can't backpedal your track away...relating to the digital footprint and its eternal-ness. Kinetic movement and energy as it exists in both the digital and physical world. Transposing physical kinesis into digital kinesis and creating kinesis between the viewer and the creative work.

-   I could even AI-generate a list of words that relate to this concept and spell out those words. Or even, I could generate the next word of the poem whilst on a ride. As in, I could start with 'body' - whilst producing the word body on strava, I choose a word based on my surroundings or something significant that jumps out at me on the walk/ride. 

## Questions re: Defining Electronic Literature

1. What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

2. How are those elements meaningful?

3. How are the works read differently from print literature?

4. How is electronic literature different from print literature?

5. What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

## Individual Case Study - Chemical Landscapes Digital Tales

# Week 5

## Writing Hypertext Fiction

1. How is it different from fiction?
Known length. How meaning and narrative is made. 

2. How is it different from games?
Strategy, winning/losing/failing, rules. The act of playing the game makes/adds meaning. Meaning is made through play. The choices presented in electronic literature examples do not give more meaning to the literature as the play does not extend beyond the act of the click. Does it add meaning/is it useful to consider a work as a game? 

3. How do you plan fiction?
You can plan a linear or non-linear narrative structure. You can plan plot points/moments of contention, character profiles. Generally in a chronological sequence of events. 

4. How could you plan hypertext fiction?

Make a visual 'mind map' with pathways laid out.

_Create a Short Hypertext Fiction Plan_
When a child is faced with separation anxiety:

(and what would it look like if the imaginings of a child came to life?)

OUTCOMES: A. the car overheats and you die. B. a stranger kidnaps you. C. your mum never returns. D. your mum returns to the car and drives you home. E. cry until a stranger takes you the front desk. your first and last name is called out on the Coles intercom and a rumour spreads about you at primary school the week after. 

SCENARIO: your mum needs to go grocery shopping. you don't want to go, but you're too young to be left at home alone.

CHOICE: A go with your mum to supermarket OR B stay in the car.

A. you decide that you would rather listen to the music you just pirated onto your new ipod nano in the car than go into the supermarket. the supermarket is boring and the ipod nano is new and exciting.

B. you go with your mum to the supermarket. the fluorescent lights cloud your mind and visions of cucumber soldiers send your feet into the aisle with the Lindt Easter Bunnies. you realise you've lost your mum.

_Create a Short Branching Fiction Story_
It should be nine short paragraphs in length and each paragraph should link to or be linked from at least two others.

## Strava Project Progress

This week I successfully mapped out the word LIVE in Footscray on Sunday 14 April. This was my first attempt at 'riding' out a route for a word I created, and although I am happy with it, it does look like the word LIME more so than LIVE. If I have time to revisit the route at a later stage I will do so.

# Week 6

## Strava Project Updates

I will draw out the following words on strava: AND, THE, PUSH, CURL, BEND, WILL, BODY, LIVE, LUNG. Each word will link to a poem relating to the word via image mapping. I plan to have a list of the words on the 'home' page that the participant can choose from and then return home to explore the contents of other words, and am considering keeping a constant sidebar of the list of words for the participant to navigate between.

# Week 7 (Case Proposal Presentation Development)

## Strava Project Updates

Ben suggested to link (via image mapping) individual letters to poems, rather than linking the entire word to its own individual poem. This will create more dimension within the piece, and more pathways of discovery for the participant. As in, rather than LIVE linking to a poem relating to the word LIVE, L, I, V, and E, will all link to individual poems. This should be consistent between words, so the L in LIVE will link to the same poem as an L in LUNG or WILL. I really liked this idea as I felt it added a layer of complexity and non-linearity that had been missing.

### New list of x9 words:

Because of this adjustment, I have decided to change my list of words around a smaller pool of letters. I have identified the 'key' words (they are key because they are the words I have either already ridden out on Strava or successfully mapped a route for): BODY, LIVE, LUNG and WILL. From here I have made the following list of 12 letters to regenerate my list of words from: L, I, V, E, U, N, G, B, O, D, Y, W.

My new list of words: BODY, LIVE, LUNG, WILL, VEIN, WIND. BEND, UNDO, BLEED. 

### Poem Concept Brainstorm

I was reminded of a poem my friend wrote a couple of years ago in a poetry subject they took at UniMelb. It was in the shape of the letter O and all the sounds of the words in the poem were of the O in an onomatopoeic way. The lines read like... oval sound is oval round, round sound is oval frown around and down.... I'm sure that's a poor rendition off the top of my head but you get the idea. These words of a 'round' sound traced out the lines of the letter. 

From here I began thinking about how I could use letters to trace out the shape of a thing, similar to how I had myself traced out words on a map. At first I thought I might try to do the same thing as my friend's O poem, tracing out the block letter L for example, using words that have an 'L' sound. I could not find a single thing online pertaining to what this kind of poem might be called, and most of the results I was getting were of concrete or calligram poems. I thought the calligram poems were quite cute and I liked their non-linearity. 

I thought I might try to combine the two, and that the shapes I would choose could begin with the same letter - eg. L could link to a calligram of a leaf. I liked that idea as I thought the calligram shapes should pertain to the themes of outdoor activity, nature and the human body. 

I experimented using an online calligram generator: https://www.poem-generator.org.uk/?i=2lztg9hm and input words into the generator that either had an L sound or simply started with the letter L. This was the result:

![leaf1gen](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/2a3d6de9-7d99-422d-8d31-0958f1d3b6f0)

My words mashed up with the 'stock' words of this tool made absolutely no sense and I realised trying to push myself into the boundaries of the letters (both shape and sound) would take meaning away from my piece, and that these calligrams were an opportunity for me to actually write my own poetry/prose. I decided that I would write anecdotally, on memories that resurfaced or experiences had whilst I was on the bike rides, and write generatively from those base ideas. I also think that the calligrams hold up a digital mirror to what I have been physically doing on Strava - the deliberate placement letters and words to trace out lines, which feels conceptually cohesive.

I did some research on the best programs for creating calligrams from scratch and found a good tutorial on how to do it on Adobe Illustrator.

I found this image of a leaf on Adobe Stock to use as a template:

![leaf](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/1ab0291e-a9d0-45ec-b12e-dacca9e4feb5)

I wrote this prose for 'L for Leaf' thinking about my ride through yarraville whilst completing the route for LUNG. The L was completed around Cruickshank park, and it was a stunning sunny day - a rarity during the turn of seasons. I spent a lot of time hanging out in Yarraville as a teenager, and I have so many memories of sitting outside certain cafes and in general areas after school, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee until the sun set. This period in time mostly occured during the Autumn and Winter during 2016, so I also began thinking of how it feels when the season starts to change, as it is now. 

*i remember smoking cigarettes in the pop-up park as green becomes orange, digging out fingerless gloves from the bottom drawer.*

*the way wind nips down the funnel neck of unrenovated train stations is how beer goes down best when the oesophagus is choked by a woollen scarf.*

*watching old barbie movies with the heater on blast is what home feels like when chilblains creep under leather lace-ups.*

*wear gloves inside the car to save fuel because it all adds up.*

*my mum drove me down this street so many times but this is my first time really being here. 
childhood fades as sure as the mist that hangs onto my windows.*

*kitchen tiles prick the toes.* 

*mushrooms spring up on the nature strip in a circle, a ring for fairies to dance in. 
fingers interlock.
i wish i could eat them.*

*laddered tights remind the bank account to brace itself.*

*when the train tracks freeze over in the morning it feels like the clock wound back in time.
i look bare next to the evergreens.*

*breathe steam in my ear on a park bench while I wedge my fingers under my thighs.*

I spent some time moving this text around to sit on the leaf in the particular way that I wanted:

<img width="995" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-29 at 10 30 01 am" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/eb8392b8-c856-47d4-b66f-a74192419f08">

And here it is without the template:

<img width="897" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-29 at 10 25 24 am" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/392f193c-354c-430d-9fab-6e6d8436b127">

ALthough it is unfinished at this stage, I think it looks a litte empty without the leaf. I might keep the leaf or overlay the text-only calligram on top of images, which will look more solid when there is more text running down the veins of the leaves. I am also considering taking images of the places, probably on my film camera, and overlaying the calligrams on those images. I'm not sure if it's going overboard but I could also record audio from different areas and have this play alongside the calligrams. 

### Personal Heatmap Discovery

This came at the perfect time as I was feeling really lost as to how I should present a title page, and what kind of imagery to put on the 'start' or 'home' page. I was playing around on Strava and exploring different features when I came across the 'personal heatmap' which allows you to view all of your previous activity on the same mapview. I was able to filter it from the dates that I began the project, and came up with this:

<img width="1365" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-28 at 4 13 57 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/c5b6fe13-ccba-443c-8ea8-90d551c1a5e2">

I was really happy with this discovery. I thought it made the perfect title page - visually laying out all the words I had done onto a map. As I am planning on having 9 words, the scale of the map will be larger and encompass more of Melbourne. The only drawback to using this is that I was previously intending on reusing the same areas on a map where I had found easy spots to plan routes on, which I could no longer do as the words would overlap. However I'm glad to have realised this now so I can adjust and create routes appropriately so that the map doesn't look crowded.

### How it should look:

As I was already planning on using image mapping to link the letters to their poems, I decided it would also be cohesive to image map from this personal heatmap as well. So, after clicking anywhere inside of the word LUNG, the user would be brought here:

<img width="1233" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-28 at 4 35 02 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/ed0aaf9e-c44c-4c80-a569-af792c5f92da">

That is a screenshot of the embedded code from Strava. When it is viewed online you can actually click to follow my profile or view the activity on Strava. (I copied the embedded code into Twine, published it to the file and then screenshotted how it looked on Chrome after opening the index.html file). I'm not sure if you can image map over embedded code that already contains links to an external site, so if not I will use the general Strava screenshot:

![53207](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/12556744-aaf1-42fc-8714-d17f900b316c)

# Week 8

## Case Proposal Feedback from Ben:

I should focus on creating calligrams for the letters that I have already mapped out. In the event that I don't get around to riding out all 9 words, I can work with what I have to choose different words or even reduce the amount of words I have planned to map out. In this way, I can work on having a small but complete project, and then build upon that. In regards to how I can present the calligrams in a more engaging way, I could start taking video footage from the rides and overlay the calligrams on that.

### Calligram Brainstorming (Ideas, Stock Images and Prose)

Focusing on the letters that are concrete: L, U, N and G (I might have another go at riding LIVE so that it looks less like LIME)

**L for Leaf - see chosen stock template image in Week 7.**

**U for Umbrella or U-turn sign**

![umbrella](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/90864af5-a4a9-4dc8-bd99-dbae9b1298d6)
![u turn](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/77e82cc2-872a-44df-b623-64afa985f677)

U is a tricky letter to find appropriate objects for, and I'm not sure that either really fit. I think the umbrella is going to be better for laying text.  

**N for Nut or Necklace**

![acornnut](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/67aa2894-771f-4485-a7e6-3b5dc9b5ff68)
![necklace](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/4c44ebc4-a23e-4519-b5a2-3dc89eb87cda)

I think the acorn is a better image to fill with text, whereas the necklace might feel sparse on the screen.

**G for Grass or Garbage Bin**

![grass](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/d1d97729-9967-4dad-aeb4-3bb3bc3c913f)
![bins](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/b3b32611-1c46-42e3-8872-cac5bc992b9d)

I think the grass is the perfect calligram template to overlay on some video footage. I can picture the grass covering the lower third of the screen.

## Starting again on Twine

I realised I hadn't been pushing any of my changes to GitHub from Twine and decided to make a new repository and new story on Twine to start fresh because I hadn't gotten anywhere except for importing and then deleting images and struggling to change the font.

## Strava Project Updates and Further Calligram Brainstorming 

Today (Sunday 5th May) I am riding out the word BODY.

**B for Bicycle or Butterfly**

![bicycle](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/854423ec-d922-4743-8cfe-3cc115902a43)

Although I actually prefer the butterfly, I will definitely trace the bicycle in the spirit of my concept.

**O for Orange or Orchid**

![orange](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/cfe98f74-4d18-44e6-8576-cb62d8ce58b0)
![orchid](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/d14b8bec-82ea-4581-8acb-f1e519190647)

Whilst the orchids are pretty, I think it's too obscure of a shape and would be hard to identify in a calligram. I think it would be cute to do a little series of oranges across the screen (like the photo). A single orange won't hold enough lines to contain a small poem.

**D for Dragonfly or Dandelion**

![dragonfly](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/44f9e31b-748b-46a0-ae57-ef774e027571)
![dandelion](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/472939dc-6175-4540-8e38-b496c5a40f9f)

I really like the idea of the dandelion seeds blowing away and those seeds containing small and sucinct phrases, however the dandelion contains too many fine lines to create a calligram and still have the font large enough to be readable.

**Y for Yarn or Yoga**

![yarn](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/751161c3-d9f3-482f-93fd-b3dccdf84a2a)
![yoga](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/36c7551f-3c70-47dc-b450-a909835176ed)

Y is a really tricky letter and I couldn't come up with much for it that was relevant. I don't either truly suit the piece thematically, but I prefer the yarn to the yoga pose. 

The challenges in selecting images for calligrams are making sure the outline of a shape is strong enough for a viewer to identify what it actually is, but also that the lines aren't too intricate or detailed - otherwise the font will be too small to read. 

I have decided to adjust my list of words slightly to be less letters, as making 12 calligrams is a massive commitment, which I realise as I look at all these shapes and am thinking about how to make the content in each distinct from the others. I also want to reuse the area that I did 'LIME' in for another word. The area of the accidental 'M' is actually great for an N, so I want to use it for BEND and revise my list of words to remove LIVE, VEIN and WILL. This will also remove V, I and W from my pool of words. I could have left V as it's only one extra letter but I am having a really hard time finding good spots to draw it out on the map, so I'm letting it go. I think this will make the project more achievable by reducing the amount of calligrams from 12 to 9. I can always create more words out of the reduced pool if I have time.

### Revised List of Letters

L, U, N, G, B, O, D, Y, E

**E for Electricity Pole or Eucalyptus**

![electricpoles](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/78a6669e-346d-4bcc-9840-3eebc126ff80)

Eucalyptus is too similar as I already have Leaf for L. The electrical wires are perfect to run prose along.

### L:

i remember smoking cigarettes in the pop-up park as green becomes orange, digging out fingerless gloves from the bottom drawer. 

the way wind nips down the funnel neck of unrenovated train stations is how beer goes down best when the oesophagus is choked by a woollen scarf. 

watching old barbie movies with the heater on blast is what home feels like when chilblains creep under leather lace-ups. 

wear gloves inside the car to save fuel because it all adds up. my mum drove me down this street so many times but this is my first time really being here. childhood fades as sure as the mist that hangs onto my windows.

kitchen tiles prick the toes. 

mushrooms spring up on the nature strip in a circle, a ring for fairies to dance in. 
fingers interlock.
i wish i could eat them. 

laddered tights remind the bank account to brace itself.

when the train tracks freeze over in the morning it feels like the clock wound back in time.

i look bare next to the evergreens.

step out onto icy gravel and my bike’s been stolen, what goes around comes around.

breathe steam in my ear on a park bench while I wedge my fingers under my thighs

goosebumps calling out your name.

hold onto yellow straps until dry skin splits into a fortune, swaying back and forth like a eucalyptus sprig, council strapped her up real good. 

your mind is choking me like there’s no room to think.

cure my loose lips

strong feet crack soles

when a hot cup of tea is the only source of comfort wrap elbows around knees

### U:

this is a list of the most powerful sounds. high heels clacking on the pavement behind you.
keys jangling, you haven’t touched on your myki. a magpie singing above your head in september. waves crashing onto a manmade shoreline. a ding in a restaurant’s kitchen. a speaker when it’s on low battery. church bells calling through a regional village at 6am. calling you to wake up to the world. calling your body into action. hearing your voice.

### N:

there was an acorn tree in the playground of my primary school. it was no hat no play and I always forgot my hat. it was my favourite time of the year when the acorns began to ripen and fall off the tree, because then I could collect them all and stuff them away in the trunk of the tree. I didn’t really have friends in school, but the acorns made do.![image](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/3b1a215f-6f80-4644-afee-f8c03fbd0dfc)

### G:

feel out the world through your tongue

like a snake

tracing a pattern down its scales

side to side

body to body

listen to what the rhythm tells you 

it whispers like

it’s telling you a story of dirt under fingernails 

peeling skin

broken bones

splinters in between toes and

what it’s like to reach down inside of yourself

tearing your oesophagus open knuckles first

unfurl fingers and grab onto your heart and squeeze

feel it throb how a heart does

do you feel it

do you like it

the bulge of your fist moving further down

its rippling beneath your ribcage 

you’re not allowed to breath in

stay still

or your lungs will inflate and fill up your neck

ribbit ribbit 

just like that

I’d ride that hot air balloon and feel the grooves in your teeth

and maybe we’d remember what it’s like to breathe

for the first time

### B:

in the space between shoes and pedals is where the movement happens. movement can only happen in that space, in the connective tissue between two things. The pedals make the riding happen for the bike, they make the chain turn and the chain makes the wheels go faster than the beat of your feet racing around to the steady, thumping pace of music. That’s why it’s a cycle, cycling, running around itself, coming back to the beginning, and searching for the end is. Waiting for the beat to hit the final round. Keep going because the word ends. That’s the beauty of the bike, it never ends. The suspense lies in between the soles of your shoes and the next time they connect with the pedals. They wait patiently. It’s a good name, it’s the kind of name I wish I thought of myself. ![image](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/f9615579-8462-4501-b5fc-7bdfb1c4e33d)

### O:

blood runs thicker than glass in a church when it’s a 30 metre drop from the bell tower. rapunzel’s hair trailing down the ancient bluestone wouldn’t have stood a chance against the fossil fuel giants, a giant burning footstep that licks flames to and from the garden, stained shards litter the floor and it’s an honest godsend that they do.


### D:

I want to clutch the moment between the thoughts and feelings and find the words, but it’s like trying to catch a fairy dancing around the circle of mushrooms that sprung up in your garden overnight. Once I caught a blowfly and I felt it quivering in between the creases of my palm, searching for a path towards the light with its thousand eyes, and that’s when I knew everything was real. That satellite dish makes me sick like there’s hierarchy, a circle of life, like we didn’t make that up. like we don’t tread heavily, heels dig everywhere we go. 

### Y:

practicing weaving needles is practicing making shapes, around and around rubbing up against each other and sometimes their lips touch, only for a moment, a brush with time. like the fly who rubs her small hands together, creating enough power to charge a fly-sized generator, and I wonder if they set it up in a park somewhere and play music out of their fly-sized speakers, dancing, holding hands, bumping into each other.


### E:

an older woman approached me. 

I saw her face peering in through my curls, her eyes poking out of sunken sockets. 

loose skin hung from her arms. 

I could see right through to the marrow. 

her whole body was vibrating, hands shaking, in silence. 

she told me I should stop smoking that cigarette. 

inhale and exhale. 

I felt it. eating away at me. feasting on nicotine. 

growing inside of my stomach. an unwelcome ovular guest.

the receptionist showed me to the door. fluorescent lights framed my frizzy hair, unkempt from the wind. I swung it open. 

there I was laid on the bed. I saw the nurse hunched over me, translucent on the sheets. 

she turned to face me, her sunken eyes and loose skin now taught and full of life. her bones felt strong. her mouth dripped from chin to cleavage with red juice. 

push up bra a dream catcher.

I was sliced open, layers of skin, sinew and tissue ripped apart to reveal the insides of my stomach. apples, pomegranates, and tomatoes spilled out, littering the floor around me. I threw up. I bit in.

# Week 9

## Image Scaling on Twine

First successful attempt at scaling my title page image (before image mapping) using the provided CSS code:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 12 54 19 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/9f473771-bf63-4a9a-ae22-7c4bae2240a3">

## Twine Pathway Progress

The image mapping does not create those visual arrow pathways between passages, which is fine for my piece as it is less narrative-pathway focused, so I don't require the visual aid.

<img width="1355" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 4 00 31 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/537a9895-4f10-49f1-88dd-9dc52c11c5f1">

I have created passages for each of the calligrams I have planned out, as well as my 'base' 5 words I am aiming to complete.

## Image Mapping on Twine

Using the online image mapper:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 1 47 05 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/6579616e-3b83-42e3-a188-ab956b3da0ae">

As my title page will only be completed once I have ridden all the words that I intend to, this is effectively practice and I will have to start from scratch when I have my final image of the personal heatmap. 

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 2 42 34 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/341a10c8-7ad3-4300-990b-57627644b1dc">

Personal note: when editing the code from the image maps website, include ./images/ before the name of the image to link it.

Success! Although my image is currently blown up, the title page looks like this:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 4 07 56 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/3d6adaa6-6e58-4f07-b7a1-bdb378795066">

And then you can click within the words, and be brought to the next image (which I will now attempt to image map to link to the letter L):

## Image Scaling

After adding the content of the image map resizer to Javascript, I was then able to update the stylesheet to successfully scale the image whilst keeping the image mapping on the right spots. 

<img width="1350" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 4 33 32 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/9b7055cd-30b1-4cf5-b527-9ddf0a0c8dbe">

And now my title page looks like this (and is successfully image mapped):

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 4 34 15 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/cff3728f-9919-4017-a53c-65e796086f8c">

Lots of progress this week! I feel like these are the first real steps forward I have taken with Twine, and so many of my concerns that I wouldn't be able to learn image mapping or achieve the fundamental basics of coding have been eased. Now I feel like the end goal of my project is achievable, and that I've gained a bit more of a skill set (and the relevant knowledge) to make it happen. The next challenge will be attempting to overlay the calligrams onto video content.

### Adjustments

In Week 7, I mentioned that I had found the embedded code of my Strava activities and that I wanted to see if I could image map on that. After having learnt to image map, I can see that it does need to be a JPEG or PNG file and that the embedded code wouldn't work.

At this stage I would like to see if I can learn to overlay the calligrams onto videos (looping) but I made a mock up of the leaf overlayed onto a photograph:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 5 25 43 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/4d4804ae-6ada-466a-a8d4-318cfc702431">

## Strava Project Updates

Although it would be possible for me to overlay text onto a looping video, I have realised it won't be feasible as I can't image map over a moving video - so I will stick to using images. I have some film photos from a road trip that I think will suit the 'outdoors' theme of the project. 

I also decided to reduce the opacity of the images I am using to overlay the calligrams onto, to increase their readability. The only issue I have encountered is that the page needs to be refreshed after completing a full ‘cycle’ of the work – when you return to the ‘title page’ none of the image map links work without a refresh, however I have not been able to find a workaround for this on twine. 

## Strava Project Reflections

### Personal

For the most part, the final work has been consistent with the goals I set in my Case Proposal. The cyclical movement of the piece mirrors the wheels of the bike turning, engaging the participant through interactivity and exploration, and I believe it this thematic consistency has added layers of depth and meaning to the project. 

The participant is given agency within the work, but it is limited – they can pace themselves but are limited to set pathways which must be completed to return to the title page. To fully engage with the work, they must continue through the piece to find that different letters link to different calligrams. This is a primary concern I have for the work – that the participant will click through each word and think that the calligrams are word-specific, not letter-specific. However, I don’t want to spoon feed my audience and take away that element of discovery.

My original aim to produce more words on Strava was an overcommitment - on top of my laptop breaking which I was unable to get fixed for a couple of weeks, I felt the impending time pressure and was unable to live up to the expectations I had set for myself. I also happened to have a flare up of my chronic hand-dermatitis which prevented me from riding as much as I had planned to, which has been disappointing. I will continue to ride out the routes that I had pre-planned once my hands are in a better working condition. 

The content of my prose poetry discusses the relation between the physical body and the outer world, exploring the way we perceive space, temporality, and the limits of the human existence through experimentation with tense, abstraction and the unknown. I chose to write prose poetry so that the piece is not constrained by the linearity of narrative structure, and so that each ‘cycle’ feels complete. The calligrams challenge the participant to consider their own relation to their body, and the way their body moves in the world. They can be read in many ways due to their non-linearity, and so the participant is also asked to create some of their own meaning within the words. This is itself a deconstruction of linearity – the reader decides where the writing starts and ends. As works of electronic literature are also inherently non-linear and embracing of post-structuralist methods of knowledge creation, the calligrams fundamentally work for the piece, in combination with the imagery that acts as visual stimuli. 

My practice has greatly developed through this applying of non-linearity within my writing, as it has challenged me to consider the subconscious rules I adhere to when I write. Knowing that the words can be read in any order, any which way, produced writing that exists within its own thematic bubble, rather than between the first capital and the last full stop. Reflecting on what I wrote during Week 1 exercise Questions: re Your Writing I had stated that “Incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others.” I believe this project has lived up to that belief, expanded upon it, and used the experiential as a benchmark for challenging traditional narrative structures and the way words move between the inner and outer perspectives. 

### On Community of Practice

My peers did express concerns to me about the length of the work and time required to actually plan the routes, ride them, code them, write for the calligrams, arrange the calligrams, and code the calligrams into twine as well. This was definitely a valid concern, and as I mentioned in ny personal reflection on the developmet of my work I was unable to fulfill my goal of having five words, which was already a step below my original goal of having 8 or 9.
