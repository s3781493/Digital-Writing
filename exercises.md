# Week 1

## Questions re: Your Writing

1. What types of writing do you do?

Literary non-fiction, poetry, experimental/lyrical essaying.

3. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I think the more experiences you have, the more external inspiration you will find. These experiences also shape your sense of self and out-ward facing lens/world view. In this way, you can utilise the natural impact of external influence to constantly evolve the way you receive and interpret ideas, and in turn how you respond to them creatively. People, conversation, relationships, observations... for this reason I am always interested in and actively choosing to place myself in situations where I will have new experiences and meet new people. I believe the comfort zone is not where development occurs, and that motivation is derived from challenge and exposure. I like to write in new places. 

4. Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use them to pursue engagement, to feel interested in what I am thinking, writing and talking about. I was not raised with the pre-conceived idea that what is coming from within (what I have to contribute to the world) is by default, interesting to other people. I love to listen, but to write is often to reflect on the innermost workings of your mind. I consider where those thoughts and ideas come from, and how I can develop the way I think to inform my creative practice in a more engaging way. 

5. How do these tools shape the way you write (eg constrain or facilitate)?

These (conceptual) tools allow me to combine structure with enjoyment. Writing can be isolating, it is traditionally a solo undertaking.  Incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others.

## Bio Note

# Week 3

Idea for final assessment: Strava poetry

- I will plan out walking/cycling routes to spell out words on the Strava app, which will combine to become one large collage or series. The app tracks your movement on a map when you give it permission to do so. I am considering leaving the (screenshotted) words in an intentional 'jumble' or even creating a sort of user-friendly/interactive jigsaw puzzle out of them, although I think it might be too complicated to try and make a jigsaw where the pieces are movable on a screen.
  
- Another avenue would be to use these strava 'words' like a link to open onto larger format poems, eg. I would have some of these words (maybe 6 for example) collated together on a screen, acting as gateways to open up longer poems which would not be produced via strava. 
  
- I might also try to write out a long form poem purely on strava, where the screenshots will fade in and out on the screen one by one.. so the viewer is presented with one word at a time. This could also be done in a scroll format. It would be a challenge to work around a word count with this considering the amount of time and effort it will take. 

-   The content of the poems will be relevant to the intersection of bodily movement/creativity/technology: how the body is making the art/writing, the body moves to make the art, the intentionality behind every movement, every right and left turn, the relentlessness of technology to 'track', the lack of room for mistakes, the lack of backspace, you can't backpedal your track away...relating to the digital footprint and its eternal-ness. Kinetic movement and energy as it exists in both the digital and physical world. Transposing physical kinesis into digital kinesis and creating kinesis between the viewer and the creative work.

-   I could even AI-generate a list of words that relate to this concept and spell out those words. Or even, I could generate the next word of the poem whilst on a ride. As in, I could start with 'body' - whilst producing the word body on strava, I choose a word based on my surroundings or something significant that jumps out at me on the walk/ride. 

## Questions re: Defining Electronic Literature

1. What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

2. How are those elements meaningful?

3. How are the works read differently from print literature?

4. How is electronic literature different from print literature?

5. What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

## Individual Case Study - Chemical Landscapes Digital Tales

# Week 5

## Writing Hypertext Fiction

1. How is it different from fiction?
Known length. How meaning and narrative is made. 

2. How is it different from games?
Strategy, winning/losing/failing, rules. The act of playing the game makes/adds meaning. Meaning is made through play. The choices presented in electronic literature examples do not give more meaning to the literature as the play does not extend beyond the act of the click. Does it add meaning/is it useful to consider a work as a game? 

3. How do you plan fiction?
You can plan a linear or non-linear narrative structure. You can plan plot points/moments of contention, character profiles. Generally in a chronological sequence of events. 

4. How could you plan hypertext fiction?

Make a visual 'mind map' with pathways laid out.

_Create a Short Hypertext Fiction Plan_
When a child is faced with separation anxiety:

(and what would it look like if the imaginings of a child came to life?)

OUTCOMES: A. the car overheats and you die. B. a stranger kidnaps you. C. your mum never returns. D. your mum returns to the car and drives you home. E. cry until a stranger takes you the front desk. your first and last name is called out on the Coles intercom and a rumour spreads about you at primary school the week after. 

SCENARIO: your mum needs to go grocery shopping. you don't want to go, but you're too young to be left at home alone.

CHOICE: A go with your mum to supermarket OR B stay in the car.

A. you decide that you would rather listen to the music you just pirated onto your new ipod nano in the car than go into the supermarket. the supermarket is boring and the ipod nano is new and exciting.

B. you go with your mum to the supermarket. the fluorescent lights cloud your mind and visions of cucumber soldiers send your feet into the aisle with the Lindt Easter Bunnies. you realise you've lost your mum.

## Strava Project Progress

This week I successfully mapped out the word LIVE in Footscray on Sunday 14 April. This was my first attempt at 'riding' out a route for a word I created, and although I am happy with it, it does look like the word LIME more so than LIVE. If I have time to revisit the route at a later stage I will do so.

# Week 6

## Strava Project Updates

I will draw out the following words on strava: AND, THE, PUSH, CURL, BEND, WILL, BODY, LIVE, LUNG. Each word will link to a poem relating to the word via image mapping. I plan to have a list of the words on the 'home' page that the participant can choose from and then return home to explore the contents of other words, and am considering keeping a constant sidebar of the list of words for the participant to navigate between.

# Week 7 (Case Proposal Presentation Development)

## Strava Project Updates

Ben suggested to link (via image mapping) individual letters to poems, rather than linking the entire word to its own individual poem. This will create more dimension within the piece, and more pathways of discovery for the participant. As in, rather than LIVE linking to a poem relating to the word LIVE, L, I, V, and E, will all link to individual poems. This should be consistent between words, so the L in LIVE will link to the same poem as an L in LUNG or WILL. I really liked this idea as I felt it added a layer of complexity and non-linearity that had been missing.

### New list of x9 words:

Because of this adjustment, I have decided to change my list of words around a smaller pool of letters. I have identified the 'key' words (they are key because they are the words I have either already ridden out on Strava or successfully mapped a route for): BODY, LIVE, LUNG and WILL. From here I have made the following list of 12 letters to regenerate my list of words from: L, I, V, E, U, N, G, B, O, D, Y, W.

My new list of words: BODY, LIVE, LUNG, WILL, VEIN, WIND. BEND, UNDO, BLEED. 

### Poem Concept Brainstorm

I was reminded of a poem my friend wrote a couple of years ago in a poetry subject they took at UniMelb. It was in the shape of the letter O and all the sounds of the words in the poem were of the O in an onomatopoeic way. The lines read like... oval sound is oval round, round sound is oval frown around and down.... I'm sure that's a poor rendition off the top of my head but you get the idea. These words of a 'round' sound traced out the lines of the letter. 

From here I began thinking about how I could use letters to trace out the shape of a thing, similar to how I had myself traced out words on a map. At first I thought I might try to do the same thing as my friend's O poem, tracing out the block letter L for example, using words that have an 'L' sound. I could not find a single thing online pertaining to what this kind of poem might be called, and most of the results I was getting were of concrete or calligram poems. I thought the calligram poems were quite cute and I liked their non-linearity. 

I thought I might try to combine the two, and that the shapes I would choose could begin with the same letter - eg. L could link to a calligram of a leaf. I liked that idea as I thought the calligram shapes should pertain to the themes of outdoor activity, nature and the human body. 

I experimented using an online calligram generator: https://www.poem-generator.org.uk/?i=2lztg9hm and input words into the generator that either had an L sound or simply started with the letter L. This was the result:

![leaf1gen](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/2a3d6de9-7d99-422d-8d31-0958f1d3b6f0)

My words mashed up with the 'stock' words of this tool made absolutely no sense and I realised trying to push myself into the boundaries of the letters would take meaning away from my piece, and that these poems were an opportunity for me to actually write my own poetry. I decided that I would write anecdotal poetry, pertaining to memories that resurfaced or experiences had whilst I was on the bike rides, and write generatively from those ideas. I also thought it was a digital mirror to what I had been physically doing on Strava - the deliberate placement letters and words to trace out lines, which felt cohesive and fitting for the piece. 

I did some research on the best programs for creating calligrams from scratch and found a good tutorial on how to do it on Adobe Illustrator.

I found this image of a leaf on Adobe Stock to use as a template:

![leaf](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/1ab0291e-a9d0-45ec-b12e-dacca9e4feb5)

I wrote this prose for 'L for Leaf' thinking about my ride through yarraville whilst completing the route for LUNG. The L was completed around Cruickshank park, and it was a stunning sunny day - a rarity during the turn of seasons. I spent a lot of time hanging out in Yarraville as a teenager, and I have so many memories of sitting outside certain cafes and in general areas after school, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee until the sun set. This period in time mostly occured during the Autumn and Winter during 2016, so I also began thinking of how it feels when the season starts to change, as it is now. 

*i remember smoking cigarettes in the pop-up park as green becomes orange, digging out fingerless gloves from the bottom drawer.*

*the way wind nips down the funnel neck of unrenovated train stations is how beer goes down best when the oesophagus is choked by a woollen scarf.*

*watching old barbie movies with the heater on blast is what home feels like when chilblains creep under leather lace-ups.*

*wear gloves inside the car to save fuel because it all adds up.*

*my mum drove me down this street so many times but this is my first time really being here. 
childhood fades as sure as the mist that hangs onto my windows.*

*kitchen tiles prick the toes.* 

*mushrooms spring up on the nature strip in a circle, a ring for fairies to dance in. 
fingers interlock.
i wish i could eat them.*

*laddered tights remind the bank account to brace itself.*

*when the train tracks freeze over in the morning it feels like the clock wound back in time.
i look bare next to the evergreens.*

*breathe steam in my ear on a park bench while I wedge my fingers under my thighs.*

I spent some time moving this text around to sit on the leaf in the particular way that I wanted:

<img width="995" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-29 at 10 30 01 am" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/eb8392b8-c856-47d4-b66f-a74192419f08">

And here it is without the template:

<img width="897" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-29 at 10 25 24 am" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/392f193c-354c-430d-9fab-6e6d8436b127">

ALthough it is unfinished at this stage, I think it looks a litte empty without the leaf. I might keep the leaf or overlay the text-only calligram on top of images, which will look more solid when there is more text running down the veins of the leaves. I am also considering taking images of the places, probably on my film camera, and overlaying the calligrams on those images. I'm not sure if it's going overboard but I could also record audio from different areas and have this play alongside the calligrams. 

### Personal Heatmap Discovery

This came at the perfect time as I was feeling really lost as to how I should present a title page, and what kind of imagery to put on the 'start' or 'home' page. I was playing around on Strava and exploring different features when I came across the 'personal heatmap' which allows you to view all of your previous activity on the same mapview. I was able to filter it from the dates that I began the project, and came up with this:

<img width="1365" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-28 at 4 13 57 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/c5b6fe13-ccba-443c-8ea8-90d551c1a5e2">

I was really happy with this discovery. I thought it made the perfect title page - visually laying out all the words I had done onto a map. As I am planning on having 9 words, the scale of the map will be larger and encompass more of Melbourne. The only drawback to using this is that I was previously intending on reusing the same areas on a map where I had found easy spots to plan routes on, which I could no longer do as the words would overlap. However I'm glad to have realised this now so I can adjust and create routes appropriately so that the map doesn't look crowded.

### How it should look:

As I was already planning on using image mapping to link the letters to their poems, I decided it would also be cohesive to image map from this personal heatmap as well. So, after clicking anywhere inside of the word LUNG, the user would be brought here:

<img width="1233" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-28 at 4 35 02 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/ed0aaf9e-c44c-4c80-a569-af792c5f92da">

This is a screenshot of the embedded code from Strava, when it is viewed online you can actually click to follow my profile or view the activity on Strava. (I copied the embedded code into Twine, published it to the file and then screenshotted how it looked on Chrome after opening the index.html file). I'm not sure if you can image map over embedded code that already contains links to an external site, so if not I will use the general Strava screenshot:

![53207](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/12556744-aaf1-42fc-8714-d17f900b316c)

# Week 8

## Case Proposal Feedback from Ben:

I should focus on creating calligrams for the letters that I have already mapped out. In the event that I don't get around to riding out all 9 words, I can work with what I have to choose different words or even reduce the amount of words I have planned to map out. In this way, I can work on having a small but complete project, and then build upon that. In regards to how I can present the calligrams in a more engaging way, I could start taking video footage from the rides and overlay the calligrams on that.

### Calligram Brainstorming (Ideas, Stock Images and Prose)

Focusing on the letters that are concrete: L, U, N and G (I might have another go at riding LIVE so that it looks less like LIME)

**L for Leaf - see chosen stock template image in Week 7.**

**U for Umbrella or U-turn sign**

![umbrella](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/90864af5-a4a9-4dc8-bd99-dbae9b1298d6)
![u turn](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/77e82cc2-872a-44df-b623-64afa985f677)

U is a tricky letter to find appropriate objects for, and I'm not sure that either really fit. I think the umbrella is going to be better for laying text.  

**N for Nut or Necklace**

![acornnut](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/67aa2894-771f-4485-a7e6-3b5dc9b5ff68)
![necklace](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/4c44ebc4-a23e-4519-b5a2-3dc89eb87cda)

I think the acorn is a better image to fill with text, whereas the necklace might feel sparse on the screen.

**G for Grass or Garbage Bin**

![grass](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/d1d97729-9967-4dad-aeb4-3bb3bc3c913f)
![bins](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/b3b32611-1c46-42e3-8872-cac5bc992b9d)

I think the grass is the perfect calligram template to overlay on some video footage. I can picture the grass covering the lower third of the screen.

## Starting again on Twine

I realised I hadn't been pushing any of my changes to GitHub from Twine and decided to make a new repository and new story on Twine to start fresh because I hadn't gotten anywhere except for importing and then deleting images and struggling to change the font.

## Strava Project Updates and Further Calligram Brainstorming 

Today (Sunday 5th May) I am riding out the word BODY.

**B for Bicycle or Butterfly**

![bicycle](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/854423ec-d922-4743-8cfe-3cc115902a43)

Although I actually prefer the butterfly, I will definitely trace the bicycle in the spirit of my concept.

**O for Orange or Orchid**

![orange](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/cfe98f74-4d18-44e6-8576-cb62d8ce58b0)

Whilst the orchids are pretty, I think it's too obscure of a shape and would be hard to identify in a calligram. I think it would be cute to do a little series of oranges across the screen (like the photo). A single orange won't hold enough lines to contain a small poem.

**D for Dragonfly or Dandelion**

![dragonfly](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/44f9e31b-748b-46a0-ae57-ef774e027571)

I really like the idea of the dandelion seeds blowing away and those seeds containing small and sucinct phrases, however the dandelion contains too many fine lines to create a calligram and still have the font large enough to be readable. It's

**Y for Yarn or Yoga**

![yarn](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/751161c3-d9f3-482f-93fd-b3dccdf84a2a)
![yoga](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/36c7551f-3c70-47dc-b450-a909835176ed)

Y is a really tricky letter and I couldn't come up with much for it that was relevant. I guess yoga is a better fit thematically, so I'll go with that, although I'm not a big fan of either.

The challenges in selecting images for calligrams are making sure the outline of a shape is strong enough for a viewer to identify what it actually is, but also that the lines aren't too intricate or detailed - otherwise the font will be too small to read. 

I have decided to adjust my list of words slightly to be less letters, as making 12 calligrams is a massive commitment, which I realise as I look at all these shapes and am thinking about how to make the content in each distinct from the others. I also want to reuse the area that I did 'LIME' in for another word. The area of the accidental 'M' is actually great for an N, so I want to use it for BEND and revise my list of words to remove LIVE, VEIN and WILL. This will also remove V, I and W from my pool of words. I could have left V as it's only one extra letter but I am having a really hard time finding good spots to draw it out on the map, so I'm letting it go. I think this will make the project more achievable by reducing the amount of calligrams from 12 to 9. I can always create more words out of the reduced pool if I have time.

### Revised List of Letters

L, U, N, G, B, O, D, Y, E

**E for Electricity Pole or Eucalyptus**

![electricpoles](https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/78a6669e-346d-4bcc-9840-3eebc126ff80)

Eucalyptus is too similar as I already have Leaf for L. The electrical wires are perfect to run prose along.

## Calligram Prose Poetry

### L: (thinking about teenagehood during winter, in Yarraville)

i remember smoking cigarettes in the pop-up park as green becomes orange, digging out fingerless gloves from the bottom drawer. 

the way wind nips down the funnel neck of unrenovated train stations is how beer goes down best when the oesophagus is choked by a woollen scarf. 

watching old barbie movies with the heater on blast is what home feels like when chilblains creep under leather lace-ups. 

wear gloves inside the car to save fuel because it all adds up. my mum drove me down this street so many times but this is my first time really being here. childhood fades as sure as the mist that hangs onto my windows.

kitchen tiles prick the toes. 

mushrooms spring up on the nature strip in a circle, a ring for fairies to dance in. 
fingers interlock.
i wish i could eat them. 

laddered tights remind the bank account to brace itself.

when the train tracks freeze over in the morning it feels like the clock wound back in time.
i look bare next to the evergreens.

step out onto icy gravel and my bike’s been stolen, what goes around comes around.

breathe steam in my ear on a park bench while I wedge my fingers under my thighs

goosebumps calling out your name.

hold onto yellow straps until dry skin splits into a fortune, swaying back and forth like a eucalyptus sprig, council strapped her up real good. 

your mind is choking me like there’s no room to think.

cure my loose lips

strong feet crack soles

when a hot cup of tea is the only source of comfort wrap elbows around knees

## Image Scaling on Twine

First successful attempt at scaling my title page image:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 12 54 19 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/9f473771-bf63-4a9a-ae22-7c4bae2240a3">

I used this CSS code in my story stylesheet:

img {  /* this selects all image (img) elements */
  width: 100%;
}

## Image Mapping on Twine

Using the online image mapper:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-06 at 1 47 05 pm" src="https://github.com/s3781493/digital-writing-folio/assets/162092719/6579616e-3b83-42e3-a188-ab956b3da0ae">

As my title page will only be completed once I have ridden all the words that I intend to, this is effectively practice and I will have to start from scratch when I have my final image of the personal heatmap.
