## Questions re: Your Writing

1. What types of writing do you do?

Literary non-fiction, poetry, experimental/lyrical essaying.

3. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I think the more experiences you have, the more external inspiration you will find. These experiences also shape your sense of self and out-ward facing lens/world view. In this way, you can utilise the natural impact of external influence to constantly evolve the way you receive and interpret ideas, and in turn how you respond to them creatively. People, conversation, relationships, observations... for this reason I am always interested in and actively choosing to place myself in situations where I will have new experiences and meet new people. I believe the comfort zone is not where development occurs, and that motivation is derived from challenge and exposure. I like to write in new places. 

4. Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use them to pursue engagement, to feel interested in what I am thinking, writing and talking about. I was not raised with the pre-conceived idea that what is coming from within (what I have to contribute to the world) is by default, interesting to other people. I love to listen, but to write is often to reflect on the innermost workings of your mind. I consider where those thoughts and ideas come from, and how I can develop the way I think to inform my creative practice in a more engaging way. 

5. How do these tools shape the way you write (eg constrain or facilitate)?

These (conceptual) tools allow me to combine structure with enjoyment. Writing can be isolating, it is traditionally a solo undertaking.  Incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others.

# Week 3

Idea for final assessment: Strava poetry

- I will plan out walking/cycling routes to spell out words on the Strava app, which will combine to become one large collage or series. The app tracks your movement on a map when you give it permission to do so. I am considering leaving the (screenshotted) words in an intentional 'jumble' or even creating a sort of user-friendly/interactive jigsaw puzzle out of them, although I think it might be too complicated to try and make a jigsaw where the pieces are movable on a screen.
  
- Another avenue would be to use these strava 'words' like a link to open onto larger format poems, eg. I would have some of these words (maybe 6 for example) collated together on a screen, acting as gateways to open up longer poems which would not be produced via strava. 
  
- I might also try to write out a long form poem purely on strava, where the screenshots will fade in and out on the screen one by one.. so the viewer is presented with one word at a time. This could also be done in a scroll format. It would be a challenge to work around a word count with this considering the amount of time and effort it will take. 

-   The content of the poems will be relevant to the intersection of bodily movement/creativity/technology: how the body is making the art/writing, the body moves to make the art, the intentionality behind every movement, every right and left turn, the relentlessness of technology to 'track', the lack of room for mistakes, the lack of backspace, you can't backpedal your track away...relating to the digital footprint and its eternal-ness. Kinetic movement and energy as it exists in both the digital and physical world. Transposing physical kinesis into digital kinesis and creating kinesis between the viewer and the creative work.

-   I could even AI-generate a list of words that relate to this concept and spell out those words. Or even, I could generate the next word of the poem whilst on a ride. As in, I could start with 'body' - whilst producing the word body on strava, I choose a word based on my surroundings or something significant that jumps out at me on the walk/ride.

2. How are those elements meaningful?

3. How are the works read differently from print literature?

4. How is electronic literature different from print literature?
