1. What types of writing do you do?
Literary non--fiction, poetry, experimental/lyrical essaying.

2. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I think the more experiences you have, the more external inspiration you will find. These experiences also shape your sense of self and out-ward facing lens/world view. In this way, you can utilise the natural impact of external influence to constantly evolve the way you receive and interpret ideas, and in turn how you respond to them creatively. People, conversation, relationships, observations... for this reason I am always interested in and actively choosing to place myself in situations where I will have new experiences and meet new people. I believe the comfort zone is not where development occurs, and that motivation is derived from challenge and exposure. I like to write in new places. 

3. Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
I use them to pursue engagement, to feel interested in what I am thinking, writing and talking about. I was not raised with the pre-conceived idea that what is coming from within (what I have to contribute to the world) is by default, interesting to other people. I love to listen, but to write is often to reflect on the innermost workings of your mind. I consider where those thoughts and ideas come from, and how I can develop the way I think to inform my creative practice in a more engaging way. 

4. How do these tools shape the way you write (eg constrain or facilitate)?
These (conceptual) tools allow me to combine structure with enjoyment. Writing can be isolating, it is traditionally a solo undertaking.  Incorporating engagement with the outer world into my practice allows me to facilitate connectivity between myself and others.
